## Definitions

- **Branch**: A parallel version of a repository. It allows you to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.

- **Clone**: Creating a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.

- **Commit**: Saving changes to the local repository with a descriptive message.

- **Fetch**: Downloading changes from a remote repository without merging them into your local branch.

- **GIT**: A distributed version control system used to track changes in source code.

- **Github**: A cloud-based platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.

- **Merge**: Combining changes from one branch into another.

- **Merge Conflict**: Occurs when Git cannot automatically resolve differences between two commits.

- **Push**: Uploading local repository changes to a remote repository.

- **Pull**: Downloading changes from a remote repository and merging them into your local branch.

- **Remote**: A version of the repository hosted on a server (e.g., GitHub).

- **Repository**: A collection of files and folders tracked by Git, along with their history.
